# K_means-01

**Brief**

This is an implementation of the K-means algorithm.

Data composed of movie ratings (from various users) is clustered into 2 clusters.

Tools used:
1. Pandas library.
2. Scikit-learn library.
3. Numpy library

**Procedure**
1. A dataframe is created from the movie ratings.
2. KMeans clustering algorithm is trained on the data.
3. Predictons are made using the model.

**How to run the notebook**
1. Open the notebook in a Google Colab environment.
2. Execute each code cell sequentially.
